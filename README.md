# x-tux-rice

# xTuxRice is our attempt at the best rice for your Linux Desktop. Anyone can contribute!

#### Note 1: xTuxRice is cureently in the `development` phase, and some, most or all of the content might be missing.
#### Note 2: xTuxRice is best suited for a tiling WM, however it might work on floating WMs as well, but those are unnoficial.
#### Note 3: Currently, xTuxRice does not provide configs for WMs, but the _desktop shell apps_, as we call them, make most of the experience. We'll later add configs for various WMs in different branches.
